## How it works?
Images are generated randomly from the local storage everytime an user reloads the webpage. User can then hover on each image to view the full image in a pop-up modal view. There is also a close modal button at the top of each modal image.

Note: The page styling is an internal CSS style, and the script file is also embedded inside index.html file.
